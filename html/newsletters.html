                            <p class="newsletter-description">The 2022 FRC season is well underway, with the main building 
                                portion done. As we begin to get into the actual competitions, weâ€™d like to acknowledge 
                                all the hard work, commitment, dedication, and love the robot was made with. Over 
                                the last couple weeks, members committed 12+ hours each a week, working around the 
                                clock to ensure that it would be game ready, to proudly represent Urbana High School 
                                at our first FRC competition as a team.</p>

                                building, testing prototypes, programming robots, and making sure everything is 
                                running along. With new members and new ideas, this is the first time UHS Cryptohawks 
                                will be participating in an FRC season. </p>
