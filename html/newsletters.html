                                <p class="newsletter-description-text">As 2022 ends and the new year begins, we all can't wait to
                                    see what the new year holds for us. As you all know this is
                                    our sophomore season (2nd year). Even though we have
                                    many goals and aspirations, we don't know what the future
                                    holds. What obstacles we will face, what competitions will
                                    we win, etc, that is for our future selves to find out.
                                    During the pre-season of 2022, we recruited many more
                                    members into robotics, trained them for the upcoming
                                    season (hence Bunny Bots), and made lots of changes to
                                    each of our departments (for efficiency and effectiveness).
                                    Even though that was our first year, we did a great job in last
                                    year's season and pre-season. Every year, we are seeing
                                    improvement though out robotics. </p>

                                off-season competition, Bunny Bots being just around the
                                corner. As you all know, we were off to a great start by
                                winning our first off-season event at Battle O’ Baltimore.
                                With the 2021 -2022 season officially being over, we are
                                focusing on how to make robotics more efficient and better
                                as time goes on. We have made many changes over the past
                                few weeks. As time goes on, we are making serious progress
                                with almost every aspect of robotics. </p>
