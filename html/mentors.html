                    <p class="description">"After graduation form Clarkson University, I started work at Bechtel Power Corporation where I worked for the next 32 years. My last position was Project Engineering Manager for a large power plant complex. Prior to that I was Chief Electrical Engineer for a number of years. My favorite part of robotics is the prototype period. I enjoy watching students turn their ideas into models and helping them with the build. I feel the robotics competition is a great way to introduce students to STEM topics and hopefully interest many of them in careers in STEM related fields."<br><br>-Mr. Gardner</p>
